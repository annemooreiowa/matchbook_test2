## About the Collection

Matchbooks—originally ephemeral in nature, but now a hot collectable item—provide a perfect glimpse into the visual culture of the 20th century. They are a pocket-sized window to the past. 
This exhibit will explore the history of matchbooks, from their advent to their development as an advertising tool, and finally their use by propogandists and subcultures.
