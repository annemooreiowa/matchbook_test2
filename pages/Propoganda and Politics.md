<b>Mini Billboards</b>

Throughout the 20th century, matchbooks were distributed for free with tobacco and packs of cigarettes, as well as given away by restaurant, hotels, airlines, and many other establishments. 
Matchbooks were an ideal advertising medium: cheap and easy to produce, portable, and they doubled as functional objects. Logos and messaging would be seen every time the owner reached for a match. Matchbooks also provided multiple surfaces for which to place designs: the front and back covers, the exterior flap, the saddle, the striking surface, and even the matches themselves.
Businesses who wanted to advertise on matchbooks could either hire their own graphic designer or advertising agency to make customized covers, or they could go straight to the manufacturer and choose from stock designs. Creating customized matchbooks allowed business to stay consistent with their branding and promote product recognition—not to mention custom covers were often more unique, creative, and visually interesting. Using stock images and phrases provided by matchbook manufacturers was more affordable and efficient.

<b>"The Golden Age of Matchbooks"</b>

Matchbooks reached their peak in the 1940s and 1950s. Cover Designs Followed broader trends in advertising during this period: bright bold colors, whimsical vignettes, and sexually suggestive imagery. Motifs of cowboys and pin up girls, dancing animals, speeding planes and sleek trains, gleaming skyscrapers, sun bathers on exotic beaches, and skiers on snowy mountains.
