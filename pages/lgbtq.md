<b> Queer Matchbooks </b>

Matchbooks were used in the mid to late 20th century to advertise Gay night clubs, Lesbian bars, bathhouses, theatres, restaurants, discos, drag venues, and other queer frequented and LGBTQ+ friendly business. Many employed coded language to hint at the nature of the establishment, while others used obvious and subversive imagery. Some matchbooks have no indication at all that they are related to queer culture without the viewer having prior knowledge of the connection.
