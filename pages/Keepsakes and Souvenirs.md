<b> From Ephemera to Collectable </b>

Matchbooks were often kept as travel keepsakes or souvenirs for special events. Though meant to be thrown away after the last match is used, matchbooks developed into a form of memorabilia. Matchbook collecting, known as Phillumeny, began as early as the 1910s and the first clubs appeared in the 1930s. It continues to be a popular hobby today.
