<b>The Flexible Match</b>

Joshua Pusey, an inventor and patent attorney from Lima, Pennsylvania, is credited with creating the early matchbook. He wanted a portable, coinvent alternative to carrying around bulky boxes of matches, and patented his invention in 1892.  Diamond Match Company (DMC) bought the patent rights from Pusey in 1894 for $4,000 and hired him as a patent lawyer for the company to boot. DMC went on to be a giant of the matchbook industry, and pioneered advertising on the tiny objects.

<b>"Close Cover Before Striking"</b>

One of the earliest known uses of matchbooks as advertising medium comes in 1890s when the Mendelssohn Opera hand lettered blank matchbooks to promote an upcoming show. 
Henry C Traute, a salesman (and later executive) at DMC saw the advertising potential of matchbooks after hearing about the Mendelssohn Opera’s success. He had a lithographer print the Pabst Blue Ribbon logo onto a matchbook and convinced the Beer company to order 10 million units. Other Early customers were the American Tobacco Company and Wrigley’s Chewing Gum. 
In order to make matchbooks safer, Diamond Match Company decided to move the striking surface from the inside of the matchbook to the front cover. To ensure users didn’t accidently light the whole book on fire when they struck a match, Traute came up with the slogan "close cover before striking." This phrase would become ubiquitous on matchbook covers until 1962 when a federal law mandated the striking surface be moved to the back covers on all matchbooks.

<b>Smoking Culture</b>

From the 1890s, the matchbook industry developed alongside the tobacco industry. By the mid-20th Century, smoking was a public activity for all—not just men—and Tobacco products became a staple of American Culture. Matchbooks typically contained 20 matches-1 for every cigarette in a standard pack. In the 1940s multiple companies shortened the matches in books to better suite the size of cigarettes as they bypassed cigars in popularity. 
The top producers of matchbooks included the Diamond Match Company, Lion Match Company, Universal Match Corporation, Ohio Match Company, and Superior Match Company.
