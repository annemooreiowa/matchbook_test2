<b>Mini Billboards</b>

Throughout the 20th century, matchbooks were distributed for free with tobacco and packs of cigarettes, as well as given away by restaurant, hotels, airlines, and many other establishments. 
Matchbooks were an ideal advertising medium: cheap and easy to produce, portable, and they doubled as functional objects. Logos and messaging would be seen every time the owner reached for a match. Matchbooks also provided multiple surfaces for which to place designs: the front and back covers, the exterior flap, the saddle, the striking surface, and even the matches themselves.
Businesses who wanted to advertise on matchbooks could either hire their own graphic designer or advertising agency to make customized covers, or they could go straight to the manufacturer and choose from stock designs. Creating customized matchbooks allowed business to stay consistent with their branding and promote product recognition—not to mention custom covers were often more unique, creative, and visually interesting. Using stock images and phrases provided by matchbook manufacturers was more affordable and efficient.

<b>Smoking Culture</b>

From the 1890s, the matchbook industry developed alongside the tobacco industry. By the mid-20th Century, smoking was a public activity for all—not just men—and Tobacco products became a staple of American Culture. Matchbooks typically contained 20 matches-1 for every cigarette in a standard pack. In the 1940s multiple companies shortened the matches in books to better suite the size of cigarettes as they bypassed cigars in popularity. 
The top producers of matchbooks included the Diamond Match Company, Lion Match Company, Universal Match Corporation, Ohio Match Company, and Superior Match Company.
